VAggie has survived the measles, mumps and scarlet rash, so when she brought home the high school diploma her parents thought she was a young lady now and couldn't catch anything more. That very fall she had a severe attack of photomania. She had the old folks posing for pictures half the time, and when she developed them you could almost tell which was which. When she was eighteen something terrible happened; she was seized with physical culture. She got busy In the gym and could hardly take time to eat. When the physical culture had its run, she was taken with actoritis. Shakespeare died before Aggie tackled "Lady Macbeth," but pa and ma were alive and had to stand for it. Just after this she got the art bug and Rosa Bonheur had nothing on her. At last she picked up a new kind of germ. It was the love microbe. When the suitor came to close the deal with pa, it was a pipe, so father rushed it through before the victim had a chance to change his mind.

VBuchanan Bartlett, shiftless son of Hiram Bartlett, farmer retired, is sent to college to learn things. Father becomes peeved when he receives a bill of expenditures a month later from his son, amounting to two hundred and fifty dollars. The old man decides to investigate things, and the following day finds him at the university. Hazing compared to the rough treatment father received at the hands of the college boys was like a social four o'clock tea. What they didn't do to father wasn't worth doing, so the elderly gentleman decides to take his son back to the farm. The story ends with Buchanan hoeing the corn field in the blistering sun.

VAunt Mahaley knew Uncle Brewster was sporty, and when he went to the city to pay off his mortgage she warned him about being too free with his coin. He visited Roger Talbot, holder of the mortgage, who handed him two cigars. Uncle Brewster was dying for a smoke, but he remembered what Aunt Mahaley told him about cutting down expenses, and traded the cigars for a couple of boiled eggs saving the price of lunch. At a fruit exhibit he filled his carpet bag, saving supper money. Before leaving the hotel he packed away everything in sight, so when he returned to Aunt Mahaley he was minus railroad fare but plus many towels and hotel souvenirs. Moral: Some people are good because it comes too high to be otherwise.

VLutie was a swell-looking "Dame," but she thought she could sing, and her friends jollied her along until she was about to send Melba back to Australia and Schumann-Heink into ten-cent vaudeville. Her mother thought she was a coming Star and said something ought to be done with her Voice. Several neighbors recommended Choking her. But first of all, Lutie must give a concert, so they hit the "old man" for three hundred and fifty "bucks" to cover Expenses. Her debut was a huge Success until she read the morning papers, but when she did, she was sick in bed for three mouths. When she recovered the Music was entirely out of her System. Moral: When in Doubt, try out on the Critics.

When he arrived at his office he was almost swamped with Panhandlers and Bums. Finally he tried his hand at fixing up a Lovers' Quarrel, and put his foot in it. Billy Speedwell, the man in the case, got hold of the Old Boy and simply knocked the Spots out of him for Butting In on his affairs. From that time on Mr. Crabb changed his mind about doing good, and the next morning made a Cleaning of the Hobos collected in his office. Moral: Cast your bread upon the Waters and it will come back to you as Sponge Cake.

VOnce there was a broad girl who had nothing to do except the two-by-four midget known as her husband, so she decided to help the poor. She thought it was a big help to the lowly and uncultured to see what a real razmataz lady was like, so when she was all hooked up behind, she galloped forth to do things to the poor. When she arrived in the tenement district, all the little tuffles between the switch track and the city dump rallied round the Queen and gave her three hearty cheers. The little dears had been to the movies, and they sure knew how to do honor to a regular sure-enough Queen. When she called on Mrs. McGinnis and told her it was a crime to have children, she sure started something. Mrs. Peacock got wise to the fact that the lower classes were unworthy, so she devoted her time to the latest and most improper dances. In the meantime the McGinnis family increases, while the tuffles became the white hopes of the future.

VErnest Coppie, an author, was trying to grind out something that could be sold for enough coin to buy himself a good square meal. He dashed off some sentimental guff called, "When Willie Came to Say Good-Night," and it was punk. He threw it in the wastebasket but when his friend came in he discovered it and set out to sell it. He finally found a magazine editor who gave him a check for $500, and it was like picking money off a bush. The author, who was an old bachelor and a kid hater, was tickled to death to get the dough, but when letters came in congratulating him on his excellent poem and sympathizing with him, he was bored to death. Mr. Coppie found a Chinaman at last who had not heard the pathetic poem, so he nabbed him for a companion and retired to the northern woods, where he hoped never to hear of his literary efforts again. Moral: When the nation weeps, the Johnstown flood isn't a marker.

VGabby Gus made the town regularly every month. He was a swell guy and thought he could cop most any Jane that he took a liking to. Clara Louise Willoughby, a farmer's daughter, with a pretty face and figure, took the salesman's eye. He looked the old gent up in Dunn and Bradstreet and discovered that the old boy was worth some coin. Then he set his traps for the daughter. Dad, however, sent her away to boarding school and when she returned she was the swellest peach in the orchard. They all fell for her. Gus hastened to her home, where he discovered she was some lemon when it came to the country stuff, that she was a real highfalutin society butterfly now, and her aspirations were higher than a poor hick drummer. She made him feel awfully small.

VHomer Splivens was a Loud Noise among the boys, but with the girls he was the dampest bomb that ever dropped from an airship. He seldom went to see a girl, but it wasn't his fault, they refused to make dates with him. Finally he saw Lucy Livingston and fell for her. He didn't have the nerve to ask to call on her, although he was just dying to. He read the lives of all the lady killers to see how they got away with it, then called on Lucy. He tried to tell her his love but he flattened out like a dying welsh rarebit. He then decided to study the actions of the more modern wooers like the movie idol, Francis X. Bushman. He also had an interview with Jack Thompson, who was an awful hit with women. The next expedition for the capture of Lucy started out with flying colors. He forgot what Jack Thompson said about faint heart never copping out fair lady, so switched to the Bushman system. Just then father entered the room and Homer couldn't be seen for dust. Moral: It has to be done in just...

VThe Busy Business Boy lands at his desk like the Early Bird with the intention of tearing off a week or two of correspondence in an hour or so. But the Napoleon of finance reckons not with the Man with the Funny Puzzle, the Fruit Vender, the Insurance Agent with the Flowing Vocabulary, and last, but not least, with Rube. After two busy hours one letter is started. It's a gay life and about noon Mr. Busy Business is making fine headway. The Rube is the last straw. He demands to be shown the gay White Light and to Revel in the Ecstasy of Chop Suey. The Busy Business Boy gives up the Ghost and, with the Rube in tow, starts out on the cocktail route. It's a busy finish. Moral: Work is a Snap but Intermissions play Hob with the Nervous System.

VOnce a lot of grown-up girls organized a club for the discussion of current evils. The principal current evil they discussed was man. The object was to find some way to keep them home at nights. One dame thought every wife ought to provide her companion with an intellectual atmosphere so he wouldn't sneak out at night to the thirst parlor. Another suggested dolling up so the flirtatious wretch wouldn't even think of other women. Hattie Jenkins felt sure any husband would stick around home if showered with affections. After the amateurs got through the stern-faced widow, veteran of four trips to the altar, arose and put over some hot ones. "What you dolls don't know about men would fill a library, your theories are a joke. Let me tell you of my matrimonial ventures." She then started in and, oh, how ignorant she did make them feel. She testified that her most popular husband was a R.R. man and was never home. Moral: Absence makes the heart grow accustomed.

They arrange to pick out Soft Ones to begin with and work up to the championship. They find a Has-Been. After the Coming Champ and the Physical Wreck sign articles, they begin training. Although the coming champ was satisfied his hard Punches would kill the poor old Has-Been, he begins to worry. When the battle opens the Has-Been does a marathon in pursuit of the Coming Champ. The Coming Champ was doing fine work until somebody turned off the Sun-Light.

After telling the president where to set off, Brad beats it without a Jitney in his Jeans. He soon lands a sucker and proves that there is "Somebody home," even if he can't get a diploma. At the end of twenty years, Ote is made a college professor, at about 25 per. Brad is a millionaire. The college gets hard up and the President appeals to Brad for some coin. Brad comes across with $50,000, for which he is given four degrees. Ote was lucky to get one degree and become a "Professor." Moral: Anybody with sufficient coin can be a renowned leader of thought.

VThe Todd family had no success in finding a suitable cook, and after firing the thirteenth one that month, they went to an employment agency and secured the services of Nellie, the prize cook. Nellie was there like a duck when it came to cooking, and they didn't understand how they got along without her before. Everything went fine, and after each meal the entire family of ten would go out to the kitchen and jolly her up. When her birthday came they blew themselves right and bought her clothes spiffy enough for the Queen of England. Then Nellie began to make eyes at the men and within a week had suitors galore. One morning Mrs. Todd went downstairs and found a note from Nellie saying that she had gone away to marry the butcher. The family was then forced to go back to the Canal Boat Junk. Moral: Give them books to read.

VOnce there was a married couple. They were just as peaceful as a couple of Wild Cats. One morning Hubby found a book on his desk, "How to Make Your Home Happy," was the title. He gave it the "once over" and decided to follow the book's teachings. He started in by purchasing clothes, hats, candy and flowers for Wifey, but she didn't "get him;" she thought he was trying to "square himself," that he loved another woman. The next day she "beat it" for home and mother, but Hubby was a "Fox" and followed her. Then came the 'Fracas" and Hubby found that he made more progress by "bawling her out'' than he ever could by ""pulling the soft stuff."

VMrs. Clymer has great social aspirations, and every time she gave a party her husband was in the habit of going to the Hash House for his sinkers and coffee. One night she panned him to a whisper for not showing up at one of her shindigs, so he promised to be on hand for the next one. Sometime later Mrs. Clymer railed the hens one afternoon for a musical. Hubby happened home early, so nothing would do but he must get gussied up and entertain the ladies. There was one young grass widow present who looked mighty good to hubby. His wife had told him to pay some attention to her lady friends, so he extended himself. Before sending the widow home he got her address and told her he kind of wished he was single. Mrs. Clymer got his number and forbade him to ever show up at another one of her parties. Moral: Solomon proved his wisdom by marrying all of his wife's friends, but the modern wise man passes them up.

VBlackstone Cooley, a studious young lawyer, could not see the girls for dust. One day while walking down the street he ran squat into a dame who looked like a million dollars to him. At last he realized he had spotted the queen of the human race. From that time on he tried in every possible way to learn her name and address, but nary a soul did he know who could arrange an introduction. He worried himself sick, and his doctor ordered him away to a summer resort. Still she was constantly on his mind. One day she blew in at the summer hotel, and after two years of waiting he met her. That was plenty, her line of gab queered her from the start. Next day Mr. Cooley beat it for home. Moral: Many who look the limit do not listen very well.

VThe occupants of Mrs. Pruyne's boarding house were very congenial, and everything sailed smoothly until one day Mrs. Fuller Speed blew in. She got the goat of every male in the flock. They went daffy over her, and the women went mad with jealousy. It was rich to see the old boys fight to sit next to her at the table, and at night sing sweet ditties to her until she threw flowers to them from her window. One day her hubby blew in the "Hash Repository" and upset all the dope. She had been "foxing" the whole gang. They forgot to ask her if she had a better half. Moral: The article you admire is usually marked "Sold."

Fred's cousin from St. Paul comes to pay him a visit. He is fresher than Green Paint, and breezes along with Fred to see Myrtle. Fred warns him not to pull any of his regular stuff, or he'll get in bad. Right away Gus said, "'Me for her," but Fred only replied, "Nothing doing; she's particular." However, in eight minutes Gus was reading her palm, and came closer to holding her hand than either of them had in eight years. The two boobs amused them on their mandolins. In three weeks Gus and Myrtle were married. The music was furnished by Home Talent. Moral: To get a fair trial of Speed, use a Pace-maker.

VThe plot is a satire derived from Hugh Antoine D'Arcy's poem of the same title. The painter courts Madeleine but loses to the wealthy client who sits for his portrait. The despairing artist draws the girl's portrait on the barroom floor and gets tossed out. Years later he sees her, her husband and their horde of children. Unrecognized by her, Charlie shakes off his troubles and walks off into the future.

VA terrific flash of lightning awakens Mrs. Durand. The woman flees into the library. There she discovers her husband dead on the floor. Maria Milton, revolver in hand, stands over him. Maria tells of how Durand, after inducing her seventeen-year-old sister Malissa, to elope, had cast the girl aside. Malissa returned home a year later to die. The blow killed their mother. Thirsting for revenge, Maria set out to hunt Durand down. "But God would not let me commit murder; Durand was struck by lightning before I could shoot." A moment later, Maria disappears into the storm.

VFatty is sitting on a park bench lost to the world in a perusal of "Three Weeks." Mabel waits till father falls asleep, then she goes to see what Fatty is so absorbed in. They share the book between them. A suitor, upon whom Mabel does not smile, wakes father, points out to him the two figures on the bench, and enlightens him as to what they are reading. They attack Fatty as a corrupter of innocence. He gives them back their medicine with a vengeance. Then he and Mabel dive off a high bridge into the river, climb out, and seating themselves comfortably on the opposite bank, go on with their story.

VFatty notices in the newspaper that there is a formal dress Grand Benefit Dance this evening. He wants to go and bring his girl with him, but he doesn't have the appropriate clothes. He and a rival for the girl's affections fight over the issue, the rival who does have a dress suit suitable for the occasion. Unable to get the money from his mother to rent a suit, Fatty manages to "borrow" the rival's suit. Despite the suit being too small, Fatty is able to put it on and go to the dance with his girl. However his rival won't tolerate Fatty's antics and decides to go to the dance and exact his own form of revenge against Fatty. Total mayhem ensues at the dance, with Fatty needing some help from a policeman to be "decent".

VFatty, in need of money, borrows a dollar from a friend who is waiting to take Mabel, a girlfriend of his, out for a party. As Fatty walks away with his dollar he sees Mabel in the distance. Mabel also sees him, and rushes to his side and kisses him for he is very popular with the ladies. All this is seen by the man who has lent Fatty the dollar and two friends of his. They also see Fatty and Mabel disappear into a restaurant, though Fatty, due to his shortness of funds, was reluctant to go. Once inside, however, the amusing; antics of the waiter, as played by Charles Chaplin, dispel his gloom until he sees his three friends arriving. They order wine, and then disappear, leaving a bill of $27.50 for Fatty to pay. Unable to do so, be is kicked out to the amusement of his friends, but just as they are laughing hardest Mabel takes his side and turns the tables on them.

VMeredith Blake, a crook, reads in the morning newspaper that Professor Riem, a German scientist, is to arrive in the city on the 10:30 train that evening and is coining to purchase a valuable scarab from Robert Hamilton.

VA woman's rotund husband finds it nearly impossible to resist flirting with any girl who comes in sight. He goes so far as to sneak out of the house in order to find girls to flirt with. One morning he spots a likely target, but the "girl" turns out to be a bearded rajah with a big sword and little patience for being mistaken for a girl.

VEnglish sleuths Grace Burton and Stephen Pryde are in love, but when Stephen inherits wealth and a title, he does not tell Grace, fearing that she will stop loving him. Grace provides support for her sister Stella Ford, whose husband is frequently away on business trips, so Stephen, hoping to alleviate Grace's financial burden, pays all of Stella's debts and provides her with an allowance. When Grace learns of the arrangement, she is hurt that he did not confide in her. Stella lives in a building occupied by a wild crowd. In the flat above her lives Netta, who has numerous boyfriends, including Jerome, an older man, and Bartlett, a young fop. One evening, the rivals mistakenly enter Stella's apartment and in an ensuing fight, Jerome kills Bartlett. Grace and Stephen discover the body, but following a series of incidents, they become convinced of Stella's innocence. In the end, matured by the tragedy, Stella is tearfully reunited with her newly returned husband.
